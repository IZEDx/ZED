ZED V2.0
=====

This is the currently most stable version of ZED.
It has been completely rewritten and supports an external API.

Documentation can be found in the Wiki.


Here are my official supported plugins for ZED:

[Groups](https://github.com/IZEDx/Groups) | 
[Essentials](https://github.com/IZEDx/Essentials)

Also fully supported is a Teams plugin which I'm currently selling.
It features all the features from the official factions plugin + even more.
